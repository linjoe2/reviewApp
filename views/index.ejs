		<h2> The Classroom Critical Incident Questionnaire </h2>
		<p> Please take about five minutes to respond to the questions below about this weekâ€™s class. Don't put
your name on the form - your responses are anonymous. If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions
just leave the space blank. At the next class we will share the group's responses with all of you. Thanks for
taking the time to do this. What you write will help us make the class more responsive to your concerns.
</p>
